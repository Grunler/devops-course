## Overall impression:

I enjoyed reading and executing this tutorial. I had not used Heroku or CircleCI before but apart from some unfortunate error on the CircleCI side I had no issue following the tutorial and I enjoyed learning something new.

The executable tutorial is a well-written and streamlined take on an interesting and useful subject. By focusing on a simple case and assuming that the reader is already familiar with using the command line and Github you avoid getting side tracked. This makes for a short tutorial that is easy to follow given those assumptions. I can imagine that the tutorial would be hard to follow for those who are not used to using Github and in particular initializing a local repo and pushing it to Github. Overall I think your approach was correct but you could add some additional links and clarifications in some places. Additionally there are some minor things that you could fix and improve upon. I’ll comment on these in more detail below.


### Time estimate and Overview

The estimated time seems optimistic. The tutorial is short but due to build times and some account setup I would estimate it at 20 minutes at a minimum.

The overview is short and to the point. I would not remove or add anything to it. The only minor suggestions I have is to capitalize the R in React and to fix the typo on Heroku.

### Introduction to CI/CD

The introduction to CI/CD also looks good to me. There is no need for a more thorough explanation in an executable tutorial like this and your explanation is sufficient for those with minimal knowledge of the terms to get an idea of what they mean.
